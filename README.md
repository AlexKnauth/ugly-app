# ugly-app

A Racket library that allows prefix, infix, postfix, and partially applied functions.

This was mainly inspired by two things:
 - [`fancy-app`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/fancy-app/index.html), a similar library for just partially applied functions
 - relations in programming-language semantics and type-checking such as `ρ ⊢ e ⇓ v` and `Γ ⊢ e : τ`
